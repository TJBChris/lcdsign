ABOUT

This application turns a Pi and an Adafruit LCD display into a miniature sign board.

It will download the weather from Yahoo! Weather using its API, as well as
allowing messages to be sent to the sign.

The weather and messages scroll in order.  A button connected to GPIO Pin 15
on the Pi can be used to force the screen to advance before the time is up.
